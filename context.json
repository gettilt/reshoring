This inherent importance contributes to a steady demand for their services. \n\nSecondly, railway companies tend to have significant barriers to entry, as building and maintaining rail networks require substantial capital investments. This barrier helps established railway companies maintain their market positions and can lead to a more stable competitive landscape, making them attractive to investors seeking reliability in their portfolios.",
